This post is a part of series on link:{% post<sub>url</sub>
2018-04-26-software-customization %}[software product customization].
Here, I present a method that avoid customization entirely: instead of
customizations, behavioral changes are controlled by configuration. The
start-time or build-time parameters of the product determine its
behavior. To use a car analogy, a flip of a button in car can swap its
leathter seats with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcantara_(material)">Alcantara</a>
instantly. This feature is part of the car itself, and doesn't require
building a product line for leather seated cars and another for
Alcantara cars at the car factory.
</p>

<p>
Shipping a software product that integrates into a lot of systems is
hard, because these systems vary from customer to customer. In most
cases, these systems have different integrations mechanisms, protocols,
locations. For example, a web shop product might integrate into the
customer's shipping and logistics system. One customer could rely on
UPS, the other on DHL, the other on the national post system, the other
on FedEx, and so on. Each of these require a certain integration point
from the web shop.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org80cb5be" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="_customization_versus_configuration">Customization versus configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-_customization_versus_configuration">
<p>
One way to do this is to <i>customize</i> the software: produce a different
version of the software that caters to this particular customer
installation, using its specific shipping system integration. This
alteration is done at the development pipeline, creating a new product
instance, where the core behaviour is significantly changed. This custom
version cannot be used for other customers, nor is the same version as
the baseline anymore. The custom behavior is built into the software,
it's not something you can swap out at whim.
</p>

<p>
While the term <i>customization</i> loosely means making the product behave
differently, in this context I specifically use to mark the "customized"
product as a derivative one. That strikes a difference between
<i>configuration</i>: a configurable product gets its custom behavior derived
from configuration, a set of parameters that determine the application
behavior that are <i>external</i> to the application. The part producing the
custom behavior is outside the application.
</p>

<p>
The part where car analogies in software tend to ultimately fall apart
is software is not a physical medium. A binary does have a size, but
whether the package is 100MB vs 1GB is largely irrelevant these days. As
such, shipping a multitude of features such as shipping system
integrations inside the same product does not dramatically alter the
size of the deployable program.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Although clumsy, the seat selection analogy works well here. A
customizable car has one of two choices, leather or fake leather. The
customer gets a car with one or the other. If the customer were to
change their mind, they'd be forced to return to the supplier to get
them refitted. On the other hand, if one were to ship a <i>configurable</i>
car, one would ship two seat sets with the car and an option to get them
swapped at minimal cost. But the customer needs to find a place for the
secondary seat set.
</p>

<p>
As said before, car analogies stop working at this point when talking
about software. The secondary seat set might be a couple of megabytes or
tens of megabytes in the binary size. The <i>logistics</i> of the additional
feature set are close to non-existent.
</p>

<p>
Since software is not really a physical medium, a software delivery
could just ship both seat sets and be done with it. Flip a switch off an
enumeration to choose between seat styles. Or shipping system
integrations.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-_a_big_blob">
<p>
A configurable software system has the custom features live inside the
same space as all the rest. Compare this to a customizable system where
different versions have different features. A version for customer <i>A</i>
has different modules available to it, since the modules for customer
<i>B</i>'s requirements are not there. Underneath, it is mounted on top of
the <i>baseline system</i>, where the standard product features come from.
Both versions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have to now track changes in the baseline
system, and this can be logistically challenging, as it tends to
engender complicated release management and version control processes.
</p>

<p>
In a configurable system there is no need for complex logistics: simply
put all the features in the same binary, and ship the product with the
necessary features enabled and the unnecessary or impossible ones
disabled. Customer <i>A</i> chooses a different subset than customer <i>B</i>, but
they are subsets of the same set nonetheless.

<h2 id="_death_to_customization_product_lines">Death to customization product lines!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-_death_to_customization_product_lines">
<p>
Configurability is the antithesis of customization product lines.
Customization produces derivative products that are distinct: parts may
be removed, overwritten, or altered. In configuration, instead of
removing, we disable. Instead of overwriting behavior, we choose another
implementation. To alter, we do the same.
</p>

<p>
The logistical problem of customization management does not vanish but
takes another form: configuration management. How do create a product
line that can take a rich product and trim the cruft to ship the
versions that are needed? The product team should not have to waste time
with a steam locomotive control panel with dozens of switches and gears
to deploy the products to customers!
</p>

<p>
As the previous article dealt with the issue of managing product lines
for customizations, we now enter face the problem of configuration
management! Imagine for a second that the web shop system has now on top
of its shipping system integration <i>ten other</i> places to connect to,
from product catalogs to order management systems to workforce
management to billing. How do we make sure we can deliver versions of
the product with the <i>right</i> set of settings, the correct integrations
and so on?
</p>

<p>
The obvious answer is that this requires an extremely user-friendly
interface. I don't mean a graphical one! Even a configuration file with
a nice, clear syntax <i>with good documentation</i> is more than enough.
Ideally, the configuration system should be something that is fairly
abstract. If you don't want to deal with YAML or JSON or properties
files, you shouldn't have to. The configuration system must produce some
sort of configuration and it shouldn't matter where this comes from. So
even the origin of the configuration must be configurable!
</p>

<p>
Aside from graphical interfaces, which face link:{% post<sub>url</sub>
2018-09-16-the-runtime-configuration-problem %}[issues of their own],
there are lots of ways for creating user-friendly configuration
interfaces. Over the years I've grown fond of
<a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config">Typesafe Config</a>, but plain
YAML, TOML or INI files will do in a pinch.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc1e1803" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="_configuration_is_flexible">Configuration is flexible</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-_configuration_is_flexible">
<p>
A configurable system has the downside that the settings need to be
managed. Flexible, lightweight configuration management is still an
unsolved problem, I think. That doesn't mean configuration is the
solution to customization needs. On the contrary, it is a much better
solution than any sort of derivative or "custom" software product line
we've seen so far, but the implication is the requirement for
configuration management.
</p>

<p>
While the baseline codebase becomes large, as the custom requirements
are bundled there, managing a large "monorepo" for a single product is
usually easier than having separate code repositories. There are lots of
ways to try to overlay customizations on top of a baseline version, but
I've found them all wanting.
</p>

<p>
So in the end, if I were to ship a web shop with integrations towards
many shipping systems, I'd create a system where I can choose that for
customer X, they get a certain set of integrations, and the other
customer gets a different set. But the good part is that I can <i>control</i>
how this happen without having to install a special product line or team
that manages customizations. This is a much better alternative than
creating custom derivatives.
</p>

<p>
Where do we go from here? So now I've closed the idea of creating
customization product lines, but now I'm faced with an entirely new
problem: configuration management! This is an entirely separate problem,
which deserves a post of its own, so stay tuned!
