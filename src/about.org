I'm a software engineer living in Jyväskylä, Finland. I work as a software
architect at [[http://www.qvantel.com][Qvantel]]. There, I build software products for the telecom
business.

I've been programming since childhood. I started my programming journey with
games in the mid-90s and gradually moved to desktop software and web
applications as the latter platform emerged. I've also done a lot of user
interface design for desktop and web applications during that time.

These past years I've also worked with designing large-scale software systems,
focusing on software architecture, information modelling, software
productization, and product engineering. My day job lets me also spend a
significant time in programming, a craft that I've always loved.

This blog is my voice on the web, it contains various writings about topics that
interest me. Most likely such writings have something to do with computers and
software. If you're interested in how I built this site, there is now [[file:posts/emacs-and-org.org][long
article]] about it now.

If you have any questions, you can reach me via [[mailto:ane@iki.fi][email]] or [[http://twitter.com/anewtf][Twitter]]. I have also
some cool things over at [[https://github.com/ane][Github]].
