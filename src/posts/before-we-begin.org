Now that the design of the site is finished, I can finally focus on the
essentials.

I've decided that this year I will be writing a bit more, here, and
elsewhere. To that end, when it comes to this site, I've had to perform
a simple but challenging task: lowering my standards.

Last year, I did not publish anything because I had absurd standards for
content. In my mind, every blog post had to be a thoroughly researched
and carefully argued piece, capable of standing the test of time.

This was a monumental mistake.

Researching something thoroughly requires an extraordinary amount of
time, and writing opinionated articles that can stand the test of time
requires an extraordinary amount of foresight --- neither of which I yet
have. I have already managed to delete one post which contained opinions
I no longer agreed with. I thought its content was rubbish and I was a
moron for publishing it, so my only recourse was to delete it, instead
of learning from it.

My desire for more content stems from the process of gradual
improvement: the more you write the better you get. I cannot do this
unless I start from the very basics. I could, of course, simply write
guides on how to do XYZ with $THING, but I want to tell stories, not
write recipes. This doesn't mean there won't be any guides, however!

Another reason for wanting to write more stems from the simple funny fact that
somebody /reads/ this. Besides Google Analytics telling me so, a few weeks ago I
even received a [[https://github.com/ane/ane.github.io/pull/1][pull request]] for typo fixes.

So I know there's at least /one/ guy who actually reads every word.
Disclosure: according to GA, most of the visits are "accidental
redirects" (huh?), and that actual, longer visits aren't common, but
there were enough for me to extrapolate that there were, at the very
least, /two/ readers.

So, that was the background. And now comes the disclaimer, of sorts.

This site is a blog. As this site is a blog, the writings are, first and
foremost, opinion pieces, not research articles, and opinions change.
You may find me advocating for stricter type systems one day, and for
looser the next. I will only guarantee that, at /the time of writing/, I
will argue my points to the best of my abilities.

Longer, more in-depth stories, if ever completed, will be available under the
/articles/ category. This is to mark a distinction. To qualify as an article,
the writing will a) contain properly researched writing and references b) be
reviewed by somebody else. I'm currently [[http://ane.iki.fi/ebi][working on something]] that may one day
be considered something like that.

You're welcome to snoop into the [[https://github.com/ane/ane.github.io/tree/master/_drafts][drafts]] folder of the GitHub repository of the
site, but be warned, that stuff is obviously incomplete.

To be continued.
