I have been thinking long and hard about how to do software customization
properly at a software architecture level. I don't want to claim that I have
figured things out, but I offer what I think is a reasonably abstract solution,
if that makes sense. I will detail my findings below, but first let's start by
understanding the /problem/.

The /primary/ goal of software customization is to /satisfy the needs of its
users/. This means implementing their requirements into the product.  The
/secondary/ goal is to do this efficiently. Needless repetition is what
characterizes a bad software product line. [[fig.two-versions][Figure 1]] illustrates this problem:
two teams are building a similar twice from scratch.

Customization is, at heart, modification. By modifying a certain basic version
of a product, one creates a /new/ product that behaves differently, works
differently, looks different---it's not the same product anymore.

The extent and size of modifications defines the difficulty of customization. A
product can be easily customizable for different reasons. The modifications
required to build a custom product might be small. Or there might be a lot of
them, but they are easy to implement.  It's not always a game of numbers.

When creating a custom product, we look back to what we are customizing.  The
base product that requires modification is a /baseline/ product.  This baseline
product establishes the *reference implementation* from which we create custom
products. The modifications, when split into discrete parts, are
/customizations/. Together, a /customized reference/ is a /custom version/ or a
/custom product/.

From a product management perspective, the reference is /a/ product.  Yet, from
a business perspective, nobody sells a reference product.  Customers always
require some modifications, and won't accept an unmodified reference
implementation. So what is the business value of the reference? Is there any
value in keeping it alive? Why not always do custom versions from scratch?

The answer is /scale/. It depends. If the deliverable units are small, then it
might actually be easier to do complete customization. This approach will
eventually prove unscalable: there comes a limit where it is more advantageous
to start sharing technology by establishing a reference implementation. Figure
[[fig.many-teams]] shows a situation where there are parallel teams building the
same product in isolation.

Sometimes it is wise to go fully custom, even with a lot teams. If the teams are
small and building different things, it is natural, since the things they build
are not related. There can always be some technology sharing in such a
scenario. If, however, the units are building the same thing with slight
differences, breaking the development process into a reference implementation
makes sense. This is often the case in product development, so it is also the
case in which I will focus here. Let's ignore the cases where the products are
different, like in Figure [[fig.reference]].

From an engineering perspective, the biggest challenge in customization is how
to keep the reference clean. Nobody wants to have customization artifacts, the
customizations themselves, sticking out jaggedly in the code. It is much more
advantageous to have a plug-in approach, whereby the architecture isolates
customizable units in such a way that it does not make the product
inflexible. If the code looks like it's full of switches and toggles for
customizationz the code can be really hard to reason about and maintain.

On the other hand, customization has to be efficient. Most of the effort in the
product development process should *always* be in the reference product. The
customizations come later, they are modifications, they are not a new
product. If a product team spends more time in producing the user-facing custom
versions than the actual reference product, this says that there are a lot of
issues with the architecture.

* On palimpsests
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _on_palimpsests
  :END:

When I think of customization gone wrong, I think of the word
/palimpsest/. Palimpsest derives from Ancient Greek /palímpsēstos/, meaning
"again scraped". Palimpsests were manuscript pages created by erasing them so
that they could be reused for writing new documents.  Palimpsests were feasible
when the raw material for parchment was expensive. It was more economical to
erase and reuse a piece of parchment than getting new parchment.

A palimpsest is eerily similar to a failed software customization process. In a
failed customization, the reference is written over to create a custom
product. This is not efficient. If the reference product is developed in
parallel by a separate team, every time they introduce a new feature, the
customizing team is impacted. They must either figure out how to bring this new
feature in the custom product, or worse, remove it entirely. Either way, this is
/negative/ work: work is done to /undo/ work done by others.

This inefficiency will eventually sink the teams. For every new feature
potentially a new /anti-feature/ is made. In an ideal development process,
reference features flow seamlessly in the custom versions. It does not create
conflicts.

Overwriting is particularly prominent in version control customization.
Customization using version control, also known as /branching/ or /forking/, is
antithetical to the idea of proper customization. I find that most
branching-based customization is just overwriting existing functionality, as
seen in Figure [[fig.custom-versions]].

What is more, people don't /want/ to do branching customization but they're
often *forced* to, because the software wasn't designed for customization from
the get-go. The is the heart of the issue. it is important to design for
customization from the beginning. You cannot add it later.

It's now obvious that the product should be designed to be /extended/ so that no
part is is overwritten. Parts can be replaced, added, removed or altered. The
customization process should feel like drawing on an outline, instead of using
an eraser to blank a canvas to draw something new.

* Efficiency is paramount
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _efficiency_is_paramount
  :END:

So the goal is to be able to maintain and develop a reference product /and/ the
custom versions. This process should be as efficient as possible. There should
be zero rewriting. Most of the time should be spent on /installing/ the
customizations. This part of the customization I call /wiring/.

There are many ways to do wiring. One of the easiest, and probably the least
complicated solution, is to use plain if statements to toggle custom logic. The
switches are turned on or off using run-time configuration. The application
reads the configuration at run-time and determines its behavior based on the
configuration.

At this point I have to make a distinction between configuration and
application. It is easy to overlook but the detail is important.  Configuration
is something that's metadata which governs the behavior of an application, the
application itself is an implementation of the behavior. I won't specify any
particular medium for configuration, it can be text files, databases, a remote
server. The important part is that it is somehow structured and human-readable,
and that it can *alter the application behavior*.

Configuration alone isn't going to solve the problem. Programming the
customizations into the reference product and selecting them at run-time makes
the product bigger. A larger product is harder to maintain.

So what is it then? By now it is apparent that customizations should not
overwrite existing functionality, the reference product should lend itself to
extension. On the other hand, piling customizations together and selecting a
subset of them to create a custom version can make the product really big. What
if there are five different implementations of the same reference functionality,
and this is true for five other features? Now you have 25 permutations to choose
from!  Figure [[fig.overwritten]] illustrates a big reference product.  Customs
versions originate from subsets of a large reference.

Different languages give different tools for doing customization tricks.
Perhaps the most basic one of them after branching logic---​if's and else's---​is
trying to use inheritance from object oriented programming.

You *really* don't want to do customization using inheritance.

* Inheritance is not a solution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _inheritance_is_not_a_solution
  :END:

Another troublemaker is to use inheritance from object-oriented programming to
do customization. This is extremely dangerous because it doing so tends to break
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle][Liskov substitution principle]]. With inheritance, customization is created by
overriding behavior in a reference class. While this makes sense for simple
behavioral subtyping scenarios, where an abstract entity is /implemented/ using
inheritance, the customization approach tends to inherit the /implementation/,
providing the custom implementation.

This is particularly harmful because the Liskov substitution principle asserts
that if $q(x)$ is a property provable about objects $x$ of type $T$, then $q(y)$
should be provable for objects $y$ of type $S$, where $S$ is subtype of
$T$.[fn:1]

To paraphrase Wikipedia, this means that objects of type $T$ should be
replaceable by objects of type $S$, without altering the behavior of the
program. In the principle any $S$ behaves the same way as any $T$.  Substituting
one with the other has no overall effect on the program.

This is where the principle collides with inheritance-based customization. The
whole point of customization is to alter program behavior, using inheritance to
do customization decidedly violates the substitution principle!

Of course it is possible to ignore the principle, but to me, it is a valuable
property of any object-oriented design. By obeying the principle, we gain
composability, since we can replace any $T$ with a $S$, and we can expect the
same invariants to hold. To me, behavioral subtyping is the /only/ principle of
object-oriented programming that makes sense and is useful.

* Plug-ins are not a panacea
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _plug_ins_are_not_a_panacea
  :END:

Let's address the elephant in the room. By now, astute readers might have
guessed that the we should be using modules and build a /plug-in architecture/
to get easy customization.

A plug-in architecture is obviously /a/ solution to customization. The process
is as follows. We take the core product and inspect it and determine parts that
are customizable. We then build the product in such a fashion that swapping out
these parts is easy. Each part has alternatives, at least one.

In engineering lingo, these parts are /modules/, and a product engineered like
this is a /modular/ product. The idea is to have a mechanism that can support
different implementations of the same thing, built in such a way that the
changing of implementations is easy.

To create a customized version, we take the core product and choose our set of
parts. A custom version, voilà ! Now the customization process becomes a
part-picking experience, by taking features off the shelf.

The reality is /somewhat/ darker than this. By emphasizing /somewhat/ I mean /a
lot/ darker than this. The preceding paragraphs described the /ideal/ scenario
of a modular architecture.

#+CAPTION: Emmental cheese.
[[file:emmental.jpg]]

Building modularity properly is /tremendously/ difficult. You not only have to
plan for the /known/ use cases---​the custom scenarios---​you also have to plan
for the /unknown/ use cases. If your universal interface stops working because
you didn't consider a case where the customization explicitly requires
/non-universality/, tough shit! Maybe you didn't enforce the Liskov substitution
principle, and your messaging system was co-opted into a customer profiling
engine, and then the GDPR kicked in, and now your data protection officer wants
a word with you!

* A strong reference
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _a_strong_reference
  :END:

A rather typical nightmare scenario is that the reference is like a block of
Emmental, only the holes are too big, or there are too many of them. This is
usually a symptom of insufficient reference engineering, that is, the reference
is not given the attention it deserves. This is the /thin reference/
scenario. In the thin reference scenario, the reference is not a viable product,
because the customizations, not the reference itself, received the brunt of
engineering focus.

It is often the case that the reference product is never a viable product, but
it should be viable /enough/. The reference needs to be concrete enough to build
a model of what the application is.  ~LINK TO CUSTOM~ illustrates a modular
architecture where most of the implementation is in the modules. While this
approach can be viable, if the modules lack strong defaults, it might be hard to
say what the reference does.

*An extremely modular architecture..*

ditaa::_images/custom7.ditaa[format=svg,separation=false]

If the reference implementations of the modules are poorly done or unusuable, it
will be hard to say what the reference product does. This makes customization
difficult, since the only actual product instances are the customized ones. This
creates an awkward situation where the reference serves no purpose but to act as
a /template/ for customizations, but the reference isn't a template!

A strong reference product is also useful for quality purposes. If any module
has a reference implementation, the custom implementation can be /verified/
against the reference implementation. If the reference implementation doesn't
exist, one must implement new quality checks for the custom implementation.

Having a strong reference will prove problematic when the reference is extremely
modular. A modular architecture /enables/ customization. A modular architecture
isn't a goal in itself. The problem with an extremely modular architecture is
you now need to maintain a reference product. That can get onerous if the amount
of modularity is large, because now every customizable module has to be built
and validated twice.

* Reintegration
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _reintegration
  :END:

Organizing the customization into a smaller set of modules makes
maintaining the modular architecture easier. If we rearrange the modules
of ~LINK TO CUSTOM7~ and group them together as a
customization layer, we get something like ~LINK TO CUSTOM8~. The idea is to organize the architecture
into the static, non-customizable parts into a separate unit, and the
customizable part as the customizable unit.

*Visualizing the customizations as extensions on top of a base layer.
This is most likely not how the customizations are organized
concretely..*

ditaa::_images/custom8.ditaa[format=svg,separation=false]

In ~LINK TO CUSTOM9~ we see that the area marked /Default/
is the reference implementation of the customization part. The
architecture is now easier to understand from this picture. Customizable
plugin belong to the customizable layer and the non-customizable parts
are in the static layer.

*Identifying a reusable part..*

ditaa::_images/custom9.ditaa[format=svg,separation=false]

It is a question of architectural /taste/ how big the customizable area
of the product should be. Some applications like
[[https://www.eclipse.org][Eclipse]] are completely[fn:2] modular. The
inverse of a completely modular architecture is an non-modular
architecture. By now it is clear that a non-modular architecture is not
good for customization. On the other hand, when working with a totally
modular architecture, if the development team is willing to put with
maintaining a strong reference product /and/ separate custom versions, a
totally modular architecture might be fine.

*Static reintegration. X is made a standard extension..*

ditaa::_images/custom10.ditaa[format=svg,separation=false]

Sometimes customizations can be seen as reusable assets that should
exist in /all/ versions, in the reference product. This is the
/reintegration/ process where custom features are made a part of the
reference product. There are two approaches to reintegration. Once the
reusable part is identified in a customization (see
~LINK TO CUSTOM10~), we can choose whether it should be a
/global/ customization. A global customization means that this is a
customization point in every version. So the feature is made a module in
the reference and custom versions (~LINK TO CUSTOM11~).

What if the feature is not seen as a customization, just as a feature
that should be made a static part of the reference? In this case we make
the feature a non-customizable part of the reference product, as seen in
~LINK TO CUSTOM10~. This is the static extension process:
a custom asset, from a custom version, is made part of the reference
product. This happens when the customization is not really a
customizable thing, it's something every instance of the product
benefits from.

*Static reintegration. X is made a non-custom part of the reference..*

ditaa::_images/custom11.ditaa[format=svg,separation=false]

The problem with reintegration is the architecture might not allow to do
any of this. The extraction of the reusable part might be impossible
(~LINK TO CUSTOM10~) because the feature too tightly
coupled to the customized product. It might also be impossible to bring
new features into the reference product because it wasn't built to
support static extension. This forces the hand of the design to try the
global customization approach.

Any of the aforementioned scenarios are time-consuming and risky
solutions to an underlying design failure. These scenarios are symptoms.
They are artifacts of a design process gone wrong. The architectural
design of the product has failed.

Perhaps the most important part of customization is to /design/ for it,
to anticipate it. But that's the hardest part of all!

* No easy wins
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _no_easy_wins
  :END:

The unfortunate truth is that you can always prepare for customization
but you can never prepare for it perfectly. Either one is /too/ prepared
with an over-engineered product or one is not prepared enough. These are
the usual judgments laid a posteriori of a customization scenario.

I have observed that we are just as likely to over-engineer than to
under-engineer. This factoid is based on my idea that people tend to
place too much emphasis on the things they /do/ know and too little
emphasis on the things that they /don't/ know, and these estimation
errors tend to be usually equal in measure. The things that we do know
characterize our design with a vision of "holes" or "modules", the
actual customization points, and the things that we don't know /add/ new
places for these modules.

Each step towards implementing a requirement, a product feature, always
creates an inflexibility of sorts. After all, a product is the sum of
the features. To create a customizable feature, one must imagine the
product with the feature removed or significantly altered. Omit /that/
step, and you will have a difficulty customizing it!

But this step can be taken to extremes. Exercising caution when planning
for customization is necessary, because over-engineering a product for
customizations delays the time to market. Creating a minimum viable
product will take significantly longer by planning too much for
customization. The flip side is that under-engineering makes
customization difficult, because you're forced to take the product apart
and redesign for customization.

It varies on a case-by-case basis which one takes the least time or
other resources. If you don't over-engineer /too much/, your investment
might pay off in the end, since adding new features will be easy.
Conversely, going over the top might have made the product too
expensive.

I have observed some heuristical approaches towards finding a good
synthesis. One of them is a rule of thumb to never build customization
on the first iteration. Then on the second instance, when the
customization becomes necessary, customizability is added. I think this
is a very Brutalist approach, but it is feasible, if the process is done
correctly. It eliminates the risk for over-engineering customization,
but it creates a need for effort when the customization is necessary. It
is obvious that this heuristic is only feasible when the planned
customization requirements aren't certain. If they're certain, this
approach is harder to justify.

By now I would say that the question of how much engineering should be
done towards customization depends on the following factors:

1. The size and scope of the product itself. What is the product, what
   does it do?

2. The size and scope of the customizations. What can be customized? How
   hard is it do a customization?

3. The foreseeable necessity of customizations. How is going to be
   customized, if at all?

And therefore it's necessary to evaluate all three carefully before
choosing the right amount of customization. But there's no universal
heuristic. You always aim too high or too low. This may sound a little
fatalistic, but I think it's possible to improve the accuracy of this
process as one learns to estimate the above points.

* Towards a software customization framework
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: _towards_a_software_customization_framework
  :END:

Programming languages in all their variety offer tons of techniques for
building customizable software. From extensible classes to monkey
patching to type classes and run-time class loading, there are many
tools out there. I think the programming part of building
customizability is just one part of the process, and while it's an
important part, it's not the only part, as you have probably read now.

As I stated at the start, I'm not interested in offering an end-it-all
solution or programming technique to tackle the issue of software
customization. What I'm interested in is building a framework, in the
methodology sense, towards doing customization. This post is just the
beginning.

That said, I'm not going to just write a post that is basically just a
brain dump of the things that I find difficult on the topic. I said in
the beginning that I have developed some rough ideas on how to address
the issue of customization. This lays the groundwork on what the
framework I mentioned above is going to solve.

- A strong reference implementation is necessary :: When building a
  product that is going to have multiple custom instances, it is
  important to have some sort of a reference to which the instances can
  be compared. Not only this makes quality assurance easier, because you
  can validate the instance against the reference, it also makes it
  easier to separate what is custom and what isn't. The reference
  product /is/ the product itself, the custom instances are just
  extensions of it. Furthermore, custom instances can produce features
  that are desirable in the core product or other customizations, and
  the reference product is a channel for adding new features to the
  product.

- Identifying the necessity of customization :: It is important to known
  in advance whether the product is going to have custom instances or
  not. This makes it easier to know which parts will require
  customization and which parts are more static. That said, it is often
  difficult to anticipate what parts will require customization. The
  architecture should be flexible enough to permit adding
  customizability as easily as possible. The architecture should also
  understand that some requirements may be missing entirely, so in one
  sense, the architecture must always anticipate some customization or
  redesigning.

- The quantity of architectural design :: In anticipating the
  customizations, it is just as easy to over-engineer for /every/
  customization as it is to under-engineer for /no/ customization. It
  can be said that for every known requirement for customization another
  /unknown/ customization requirement is going to materialize
  eventually. Creating an overly composable, supremely modular
  architecture is not a good idea; conversely creating a rigid and
  static architecture is equally a bad idea. In my view, there are no
  universal heuristics on just how much is necessary. It requires
  judgment on a case-by-case basis, especially by taking the previous
  two points into account.

This post became /way/ longer than I originally intended to. I
originally wanted to present a particular customization technique using
the tricks of one particular programming language and programming
environment, but as it grew larger I wanted to give the topic a broader
treatment. But this barely even scratches the surface. I have not even
spoken on how to do customization in practice at all.

I suppose at this point this post is a beginning in a series of longer
ones, treating the individual elements of the previous list in a more
profound manner. This is a very large topic in general, as it broaches
fields from software architecture to product management to requirements
engineering to actual programming.

That is not to say I plan to devote the whole blog towards software
product engineering, let alone write a book about it (though that would
be interesting), but as I deal with these topics daily in my job, it's a
very interesting topic /to me/. So interested readers can possibly
expect more of the subject!

These ideas are just materializations of my recurring thoughts while
designing software products, and most of them are not new. A step in
/any/ direction is going to lead one towards what is known as /software
product line engineering/, that is, recognizing that the creation of
software /products/ can be understood using /product lines/.

Fundamentally, the art of customization is about software reuse. For a
deeper introduction to the idea of reuse I recommend the book /Software
Reuse: Architecture, Process and Organization for Business Success/
cite:[jacobson1997]. From the concepts of /reuse/ it is easy to make the
transition to the idea of software product lines. A good introduction to
the subject are the books /Software Product Lines: Practices and
Patterns/ cite:[pohl2005software], and /Software Product Line
Engineering: Foundations, Principles and Techniques/
cite:[clements2002software].
